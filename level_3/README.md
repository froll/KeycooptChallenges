# Keycoopt code challenges: level 3!
## Context

## Challenge
Update the `Person` class so that it has a _gender_ (a boolean) instead of a _title_. Instances of the 
class should respond to the following methods: `#gender`, `#gender=`, `#male?` and `#female?`. Then 
parse the source CSV file, and return instances of the `Person` class accordingly.
